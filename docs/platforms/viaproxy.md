# ViaProxy

The bridge between the newest-protocol driver and an older server (ADR-0004,
[client-driver spec](../specs/client-driver.md) section 5). Core starts it only for *bridged* cells, on the cell
network, and never installs Via plugins in the server under test.

## Image
- `ghcr.io/viaversion/viaproxy`, pinned by index digest in `versions.yml` (`drivers.viaproxy`). GPL-3.0, run as a
  separate container and never linked (ADR-0011).
- Pinned build: ViaProxy 3.4.15 (`latest` on 2026-11-07), Java 25, supports servers 1.7+ and clients up to 26.3.
- The image entrypoint is `java -jar /app/ViaProxy.jar config viaproxy.yml` in `/app/run`. That mode needs a config
  file. Core overrides the entrypoint with `java -jar /app/ViaProxy.jar` and passes `cli` plus flags, so no file is
  copied or mounted (ADR-0005).

## CLI flags (verified by running the pinned image with `cli --help`)
| Need | Flag | Value core passes |
|---|---|---|
| Bind address and port | `--bind-address <host:port>` | `0.0.0.0:25568` (default is the same) |
| Target server | `--target-address <host:port>` | `server:25565` (the server's network alias) |
| Target version | `--target-version <name>` | the row's `mc`, for example `1.8.8` |
| Offline auth | `--auth-method <NONE\|ACCOUNT\|OPENAUTHMOD>` | `NONE` (the default, set explicitly) |

- `--target-version` accepts a plain version inside a ViaProxy range name: `1.8.8` matches the range `1.8.x`
  (`cli --list-versions` prints the names). The default, `Auto Detect (1.7+ servers)`, is never used: the target is
  always explicit.
- `--proxy-online-mode` defaults to false, so the proxy does not authenticate clients against Mojang.

## Topology
- One Docker network per bridged cell. The server joins it with the alias `server`, ViaProxy with `viaproxy`.
- The driver connects to ViaProxy's mapped port on the Docker host. The server's own game port stays published, but a
  bridged cell's client never uses it.
- Ready means ViaProxy's bind port is in the container's listening socket table. The log line "Binding proxy
  server" is printed before the bind, so it is not used.

## Gotchas
- Docker on Windows under Git Bash rewrites `/app/...` arguments into `C:/Program Files/Git/app/...`. Use PowerShell
  (or `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`) when running the image by hand.
